# What's new?
I will do my best to keep you all in the loop about changes and updates for Skate Trace. In it's current stage, this page will be updated pretty regularly.

<br>

### `Testflight Build`
# **Version 0.9**
This is the first stable version of the app. It's been a hectic couple of weeks. Due to Covid-19, I thought "Let's build an app". I'm hoping there is a market for it. It is going out to Testflight in the next couple of days. 

#### What's New
- Everything!
- Created this website!

#### Bug Fixes
- Probably lots to be fixed, but none that I'm aware of yet.

<br>

### **Version 0.9.1**
One day in and already finding bugs and issues. This is a small update that fixes a few issues that the app was having. Most of the bugs are simple UI changes. But this update adds some much needed features.

#### What's New
- You can now delete tests and/or competitions. Handy if you have entered some information incorrectly.
- Added some information about any third party libraries that were used. Don't want to get sued.

#### Bug Fixes
- Tests were being shown in the wrong order. It now prioritises date over level.
- When viewing tests, you can now see what test you are looking at.
- Calculating the percentage of the test stream that had been completed was returning the wrong value.
