# Privacy Policy
Your data privacy is important to us. We have done our best to outline how your data is collected, stored and deleted, as easily as possible. We encourage you to read the entire document. The SkateTrace iOS app maybe referred to as ‘SkateTrace’, ‘iOS app’ or ‘app’ within this document.

<br>

## 1.0 Information We Collect
Below we have outlined all information that is collected when using the iOS App. It has been split into 2 seperate sections. 
- Data that can be used to identify a single person.
- Data that a format that cannot be used, in it's current form, does not permit direct association with an individual.
This app does not collect any information for sales purporses, and we have no contracts/obligations with any third party to pass your data on.

### 1.1 Personal Information
The app allows coaches to create athletes to track their figure skating journey. Within the creation stages, users are asked to input the following information. 
- Name
- Age
- Gender
- The nation that they skate for.*
Whilst this information is there to aid the user, most is not required. The app allows users to skip sections in the attempt to provide users with piece of mind.
**The Skating Nation is used to load the correct test structure for the skater**. 

### 1.2 Non-Personal Information 
The app stores the programs (figure skating routines) and figure skating tests within your iOS device’s memory. We do not have access to any of the data that you score. We do not log any keystrokes, search queries or how you use our app.

<br>

## 2.0 Payment
The iOS app payment goes directly through the Apple iTunes payment system. We do not see any of your payment information, nor any personal information that can be directly tied to you as a user.

<br>

## 3.0 Your Rights
Consistent with applicable law, you may exercise any of the rights described in this section. However, we do **not collect any information about you.**

### 3.1 Managing Your Information.
There is no information stored about the user within this app. However, you can delete all athletes stored within the app from Settings > Delete All Data.  You are responsible for this action. If you remove all the data, it cannot be retreived by us, since it is all stored locally.

### 3.2 Data Access and Portability.
The app holds a feature for sharing across your iOS Devices. This is not mandatory. But if you choose to share across devices, this information is stored on **your** private iCloud storage. We do not have any access to this data.

### 3.3 Data Retention and Erasure.
